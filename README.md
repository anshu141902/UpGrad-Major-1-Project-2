# Project Name
Bike-Sharing Service

> Outline a brief description of your project.
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the daily demand for a bike-sharing service using historical data and linear regression modeling. The dataset comprises two years of daily records, capturing both environmental and user-based features such as temperature, humidity, season, weather conditions, holiday flags, and the number of registered and casual users. The goal is to understand the key factors influencing bike rentals and build a predictive model to estimate the total number of bikes rented on any given day (cnt). By exploring relationships between variables and applying a linear regression approach, the project aims to deliver insights that can support operational planning and decision-making in bike-sharing systems. The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using statistical metrics like R-squared, RMSE, and MAE to ensure its reliability and accuracy.



## General Information

- What is the background of your project?
The project is built around the increasing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly transportation in urban areas. With the growing popularity of bike-sharing systems worldwide, understanding the factors that influence daily bike rentals has become essential. This project aims to leverage data-driven techniques to explore patterns in bike usage and develop a predictive model that can estimate rental demand under varying conditions.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
The core business challenge is to accurately predict the number of bikes required on a given day to ensure optimal resource allocation, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Overestimating demand can lead to unnecessary costs, while underestimating can result in shortages and lost revenue. The model aims to help bike-sharing companies better plan for daily fluctuations in demand based on external factors such as weather, season, and holidays.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset used in this project contains daily bike rental data for two years. It includes a variety of features such as date, season, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, whether the day is a working day or a holiday, and counts of casual and registered users. The target variable is cnt, which represents the total number of bikes rented on a given day. This dataset serves as the foundation for analysis and model development.
